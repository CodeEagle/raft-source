 * config, no models, not installed, unsupported) drops the entry: the runtime
 * said it cannot be used now, and an old list must not keep offering models.
 * A transient failure (timeout, a failed probe, a lookup that did not decide, or a retryable error naming no cause) keeps the
 * previous list, so one slow background refresh does not turn the next form
 * open back into a blocking wait.
 *
 * Runtime model lists are usable-now answers (login, plan and config change
 * them), so the cache is short and a caller can always force a fresh read.
