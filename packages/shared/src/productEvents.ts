// Product event registry (RFC-067 §3.2).
//
// Every product event and its allowed properties is declared here, once, for
// every client and for server ingest. Clients get their typed `track()` API
// from it; ingest rejects (and counts) anything validateProductEvent refuses.
//
// Product events are designed on purpose. Add, rename or remove one only with
// the event-registry owner's sign-off, never as a side effect of feature work:
// each entry states the question it answers and who asked. Properties are
// low-cardinality ids/enums/counts only — never message text or other user
// content. Names starting with `$` are reserved for fields the pipeline adds.
//
// PRODUCT_EVENT_REGISTRY is plain JSON-shaped data on purpose: native clients
// (RFC-067 §6) will generate their APIs from a JSON export of it.

// NOT A SETTLED RULE — pending RFC-067 §9.4 (legal review of regional
// defaults). What "Share usage data" means for a user who has not chosen; the
// server gate and the settings UI both read it.
